## Description

This project was made to practice promises, asynchrony, API's, static methods. The project uses the 'Deck of Cards' API to generate a shuffled deck of cards and deals them to the player and the dealer. The project also uses a static method with a promise to make sure the code is executed only when an API call to 'Deck of Cards' is successful.
